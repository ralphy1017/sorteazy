# SORTeaZy
Perform photometry on JWST images using Source Extractor and EAZY.

## Important Classes and Methods

### PrepImg.py

Convert default MAST i2d.fits files into pixel-aligned science and weight extensions.

__init__() - Splits and reprojects i2d.fits files and prints the field, image directory, and image naming scheme, which can be fed to the sextractor class.

		Arguments: 
		image_dir - directory in which the i2d.fits files are stored
		file - pattern of filenames of the images (replace the filter with *)        
		field - field name to put in image and catalog files

		Returns: Nothing, but prints field, image_dir, new file pattern, and zeropoints


bkgsub() - Can be called after go() to subtract the background from the images.

		Arguments: 
		size - size of tiles to compute and subtract background from (default 100 pixels)

		Returns: Nothing, but prints field, image_dir, and new file pattern


### SExtractor.py

Run source extractor on science and weight images created by prepimg, and produce plots.

__init__() - gets necessary info to run source extractor

		Arguments: 
		field - field name
		image_dir - directory that contains images
		imfile - image file naming scheme
		cat_dir - directory to place catalogs
		zp - array of zeropoints in the form (zp_sw, zp_lw) (default 28.0865 for both - true for 30mas pixels)

		Returns: Nothing

set_psf() - sets bounds of fwhm and magnitude to do star-galaxy separation

		Arguments: 
		filt - filter that it applies to
		fwhm - minimum fwhm that an object (star or galaxy) can have to be counted in the plots
		end - maximum fwhm that a star can have
		mag - maximum magnitude that a star can have

		Returns: Nothing

set_sb() - sets shape of surface brightness and point source sensitivity limit

		Arguments: 
		filt - filter that it applies to
		sb_min - point source sensitivity limit (magnitude)
		sb_turn - fwhm where the point source and surface brightness sensitivity limits meet
		sb_slope - slope of the surface brightness sensitivity

		Returns: Nothing

sextract() - gets images, gets pixel sizes, gets areas, gets exposure times, and runs source extractor

		Arguments: 
		config_file - absolute path to SExtractor configuration file
		dual - dual image mode option (default False=don't run dual image, else specify filter to use as detection image)
		overwrite - whether or not to overwrite the files (default False)

		Returns: Nothing

run_plots() - creates photometry plots using previously created SExtractor catalogs

		Arguments: None
		Returns: Nothing
           

### MakeCats.py

Makes a custom catalog in AB Mag using each catalog generated from SExtractor so that it may be passed to eazy to find the Photometric Redshift of each object in the catalog

__init__() - Receives necessary info to initialize a field with its catalogs
            
		Arguments:
		field - the field name
		cat_dir - catalog directory where SExtractor catalogs exist on your machine
		cat_file - catalog file namestyle so that it can group catalogs in each filter
		pixsize - pixel size found in fits file data

		Returns: Nothing

match() - Filters nondetections and aligns each catalog using SkyCoord and then writes to a single catalog for eazy

		Arguments:
		det_filt - string of the name of the filter to use as the matching filter

		Returns: Nothing


### eazyMethods.py

Runs eazy wherever it exists on your machine and then generates SED vs Chi^2 Plots with eazy photometric Output

__init__() - Receives location of eazy and the custom parameters 

		Arguments:
		eazypath - path to eazy-photoz on your machine to navigate files properly
		params - dictionary of parameters with correct parameter formatting to then write to zphot.param so that it  
		     overides zphot.param.default

		Returns: Nothing

makeparam() - makes zphot.param file 

		Arguments: None
		Returns: Nothing

run() - runs eazy on your machine, set logfile=False to show output. Otherwise, output is written to a log file 
        ex: ../src/eazy > logifle

		Arguments: 
		logfile - logfile=False to show output, logfile=True to save output to a log file (default True)

		Returns: Nothing (but runs EAZY so saves all of the resulting files in OUTPUT directory)

makePlots() - makes SED template plots, Chi^2 vs Z plots from eazy output, and color stamps of individual high-z galaxies. 

		Arguments:
		output_dir - path of eazy OUTPUT directory
		imrgb - array of RGB values for entire field
		zmin - minimum redshift value to make plots for (default 7)
		zmax - maximum redshift value to make plots for (default 100)

		Returns: eazy plots + color stamps of high-z galaxies


### Trilogy.py

Creates color images from science images so that it can be fed to eazyMethods.py for plotting individual galaxies.

__init__() - receives location of image files, as well as the field name for saving images.

		Arguments:
		image_dir - directory that contains science images
		imfiles - pattern of filenames within image_dir
		field - name of field

		Returns: Nothing, but prints filters and images corresponding to each filter

bkgsub() - subtracts background from science images

		Arguments: None
		Returns: Nothing

auto_colors() - assigns colors to each filter from purple (short wavelength) to red (long wavelength)

		Arguments: None
		Returns: prints contribution of each filter to R, G, B (in that order)

make_stamp() - creates a color image stamp to assign levels to the various parameters of Trilogy.

		Arguments:
		sample_size - side width of square image (default 1000)
		dx - shift from the center of the image in pixels (right = positive) (default 0)
		dy - shift from the center of the image in pixels (up = positive) (default 0)
		noiselum - saturation value of pixels at noisesig sigma above the mean surface brightness value (default 0.12) (spans from 0-1)
		satpercent - percent of pixels to be saturated at 1.0 (default 0.001)
		noisesig - number of sigma above the mean for pixels to have a value of noiselum (default 1)
		noisefloorsig - number of sigma below the mean for pixels to be black (0.0) (default 2)

		Returns: color image stamp as a matplotlib plot

make_RGB() - makes full field RGB image from scaling found with make_stamp()

		Arguments: None
		Returns: Nothing

enhance() - enhances full field RGB image and saves it.

		Arguments:
		color - color enhancement multiplier (1.0 = no change) (default 1.3)
		contrast - contrast enhancement multiplier (default 1.4)
		brightness - brightness enhancement multiplier (default 1.1)
		sharpness - sharpness enhancement multiplier (default 1.9)

		Returns: array of RGB values, and saves enhanced image in image_dir
